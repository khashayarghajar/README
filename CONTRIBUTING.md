### Coding conventions
- I indent using four spaces `soft tabs` .
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace .
- Check your spelling and grammar .
- Start the Name with a capital .
- Complexity is a factor going against security so do coding in simplicity .
- Every code file that you write needs to have a comment at the top explaining exactly what it does and, if applicable, how to run it .
- variables should have the most restrictive scope possible .

### Local Development
- Create or edit `.env` file in the root of the directory
