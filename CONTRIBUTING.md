# ♽ Submitting changes #
- Always write a clear log message for your commits . One-line messages are fine for any changes .

- - - -

# 🛠 Testing #
- test data and test codes are both accepted .
- only add or remove tests that are located in `./test` .
- Please include a brief description of what the test does in the pull request .
- After writing your new test, please check whether it works or not .
- If you've added your test to an existing class, you will need to run the whole class and track the output .
- write some new tests means delete the old ones .

# 🖥 Coding conventions #
- I indent using four spaces `soft tabs` .
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace .
- Check your spelling and grammar .
- Start the Name with a capital .
- Complexity is a factor going against security so do coding in simplicity .
- Every code file that you write needs to have a comment at the top explaining exactly what it does and, if applicable, how to run it .
- variables should have the most restrictive scope possible .
- Make sure your code passes the tests .
- Make sure your code is properly commented and documented .
